  A Simple summary goes here.
abstract: "A single paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For research articles, abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. We strongly encourage authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, but without headings: (1) Background: Place the question addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; (2) Methods: Describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; (3) Results: Summarize the article's main findings; and (4) Conclusions: Indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an objective representation of the article, it must not contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions."
keywords: "keyword 1; keyword 2; keyword 3 (List three to ten pertinent keywords specific to the article; yet reasonably common within the subject discipline.)"

#### How to Use This Template {.zero}

This template was addapted from the MPDI published journal Remote Sensing's word document template. This adaptation is still a work in progress but now meets the criteria for a submitted manuscript to any of the MDPI publications. Please report any issues or feature request/ suggestion on the [pagedown github issues](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/issues) page. Following this paragraph is the word for word replication of the copied template. 

The template details the sections that can be used in a manuscript. Sections that are not mandatory are listed as such. The section titles given are for Articles. Review papers and other article types have a more flexible structure.
Remove this paragraph and start section numbering with 1. For any questions, please contact the editorial office of the journal or support@mdpi.com.

# Introduction

The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the principal conclusions. As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research. References should be numbered in order of appearance and indicated by a numeral or numerals in square brackets, e.g., [@R-pagedown] or [@R-knitr; @R-pagedown], or [@R-pagedown; @R-knitr; @R-bookdown]. See the end of the document for further details on references.

# Materials and Methods

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly available database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review.

They must be provided prior to publication.
Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.

# Results

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.

## Subsection

### Subsubsection

Bullet lists look like this:

- First bullet
- Second bullet
- Third bullet

Numbered lists can be added as follows:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Text continues here.

## Figures, Tables, and Schemes

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure \@ref(fig:myfigure), Table \@ref(tab:mytable), etc.

```{r myfigure, fig.cap='This is a figure, Schemes follow the same formatting. If there are multiple panels, they should be listed as: (a) Description of what is contained in the first panel; (b) Description of what is contained in the second panel. Figures should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are cited. A caption on a single line should be centered.', out.width='90%', fig.height=4}

par(mfrow = c(1,2))

plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, col = iris$Species, pch = 19, xlab = "Sepal Length \n (a)", ylab = "Sepal Width")
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width, col = iris$Species, pch = 19, xlab = "Petal Length \n (b)", ylab = "Petal Width")
```

```{r mytable}
knitr::kable(iris[1:3,], align = 'c', caption = 'This is a table. Tables should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are cited.')
```

## Formatting of Mathematical Components

This is an example of an equation, you may use an inline reference like so, Equation \@ref(eq:eqExample):
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
(\#eq:eqExample)
\end{equation}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.

# Discussion

Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted in perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.

# Conclusion

This section is mandatory.

# Patents

This section is not mandatory, but may be added if there are patents resulting from the work reported in this manuscript.

# Appendix A {.nonum}

The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text. For example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text, but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data is shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary data. Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.

# Appendix B {.nonum}

All appendix sections must be cited in the main text. In the appendixes, Figures, Tables, etc. should be labeled starting with ‘A’, e.g., Figure A1, Figure A2, etc.

# References {.nonum}
